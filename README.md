# 📜 AI-Powered Regulatory Compliance Checker for Contracts 🚀

An end-to-end **Generative AI–driven system** that automatically reviews contracts, detects regulatory compliance risks (GDPR, HIPAA), identifies missing clauses, generates legally safe amendments, and provides real-time alerts and audit logs.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Manual contract compliance review is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale.
This project solves that problem by using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to:

* Extract legal clauses from contracts
* Analyze regulatory and legal risks
* Detect missing or weak compliance clauses
* Automatically suggest safe amendments
* Track live regulatory updates
* Notify stakeholders via Email, Slack, and Google Sheets
* Generate updated contracts and compliance reports

The system is designed to be **modular, reliable, explainable, and production-ready**.
